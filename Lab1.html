    <h1>Welcome To Lab 1</h1>
    <p>This will be the first test that I will submit on my journey to completing this course. The two requirements are one image and one hyperlink. However I will attempt to include a little of everything aside from styling. I will save the styling for when we cover CSS.</p>
    <h2> Things that we have covered.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lists are a great way to not only organize your HTML but to also make what appears on your browser to me more uniform</li>
        <li>If you check the workspace you will notice that the <strong>li</strong> has a beginning and end tag. Now although this is not necessary for list item, I chose to include it to visualize it better.</li>
        <li>This list is pretty straight forward but I can also nest a list within this list. Lets do just that
            <ol>
                <li>If you notice this list item has a number and not a bullet point. This occurs when you use an ordered list and not a unordered list</li>
                <li>You will also notice that it indents the second list under whichever list item you put it.</li>
                <li>One small detail about nesting that you dont want to forget is that tags such as <em>ol</em> and <em>ul</em> require a closing tag. Without the closing tag the text editor will not automatically understand where to end.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>For a full HTML document to be written you must create a <mark>DOCTYPE html</mark>. This will include components such as language, a head, and a body for your HTML document.</li>
        <li>Now we will include one item that will be able to work as both a hyperlink and an image. For the sake of differentiating the two the image that is displayed will be the hyperlink, however it will send you to another image.</li>
    </ul>
