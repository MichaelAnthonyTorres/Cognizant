                As the largest lizard in the world, Komodo dragons easily take down prey as large as deer and water Buffalo. One bite can prove to be fatal as their venom lowers blood pressure and does not allow the blood to clot causing any prey to bleed to death. Female dragons are able to reproduce asexually should there not be a male to reproduce with them.
