        <li>Markup is when you use opening and closing tags in order to be able to change the text in the file.
        <li>An example would be <em>em is for emphasis</em> which would italicize anything written in between the tags. Another common markup would be <h1>H1 is a header</h1> for headers or <p>writes plain text</p> for paragraphs.
        <li>Here is a proper use of the p tag. 
            <p>As the days go by I find myself being less and less active. It seems as though the years of youth have long since left me and now the only thing that shows is the scars of life called age.</p>
            <p>The rattles are no longer from the shaking of baby toys but rather from the cracking of bones as i get up from a chair.</p>
            <p>With the tunnels end coming closer and closer and the light grows brighter it becomes harder and harder to ignore.</p> 
            What was once a dim light seemingly impossible to reach has now become a vanity light illuminating every crack and crevice.
        <li>Ordered lists will create lists that will be numbered or have letters. Unordered lists will use bulletpoints. Either is fine to use depending on your specific project.
        <li>Adding target="blank" to an anchor tag will open up a new broswer tag.
